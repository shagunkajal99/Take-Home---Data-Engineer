# Take-Home---Data-Engineer

The project involves extracting data from the public platform Github, performing data transformations, and loading the data into PostgreSQL and AWS S3. Additionally, a lambda function has been created to calculate metrics and obtain useful insights.

The process begins with extracting the data from Github using appropriate methods and libraries. Once the data is obtained, transformations are applied to manipulate and shape the data according to the desired format. These transformations may include cleaning the data, merging datasets, aggregating information, and deriving new variables.

After the data is transformed, it is loaded into PostgreSQL, which serves as a relational database management system. The data is organized into tables and stored in the database for further analysis and retrieval.

Simultaneously, the transformed data is also stored in AWS S3, which is a scalable storage service provided by Amazon Web Services. This allows for easy access and sharing of the data across different systems and applications.

To gain insights and perform calculations on the data, a lambda function is implemented. The lambda function utilizes the extracted and transformed data to calculate various metrics and generate meaningful insights. These calculations involve aggregating data.

The results of the calculations are then written back to AWS S3 as CSV files. These output files contain the calculated metrics and insights, which can be further utilized for reporting, visualization, or other downstream processes.

Overall, the project encompasses the entire data lifecycle, starting from data extraction from Github, transformation and cleaning of the data, loading into PostgreSQL and AWS S3, and finally, performing metrics calculations and generating insights using a lambda function.
